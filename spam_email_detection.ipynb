By automatically filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful emails, users are protected from phishing attacks, malware, and other malicious content. This not only reduces the likelihood of users falling victim to scams but also improves email organization by keeping the inbox free of clutter. As a result, users can focus on important messages without the distraction of spam. Additionally, spam detection can save time by minimizing the need to manually sort through emails, thereby increasing productivity. From a business perspective, it also helps maintain the integrity of communication channels, ensuring that legitimate emails are not overlooked amidst spam, thereby improving overall communication efficiency."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# **‚è¨Importing Data**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-18T08:46:35.421981Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-18T08:46:35.421532Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-18T08:46:35.480337Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-18T08:46:35.479138Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-18T08:46:35.421912Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Category</th>\n","      <th>Message</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>ham</td>\n","      <td>Go until jurong point, crazy..
